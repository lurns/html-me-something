                <h2>The Con</h2>
                <h3>Tegan and Sara</h3>
                <h4>2007</h4>
                <p>It's hard to narrow down a favorite T&S album (and checking my old last.fm account shows
                    <em>If It Was You</em> has more plays). Perhaps the bias is because <em>The Con</em> came 
                    out when I was about to start my senior year in high school and I have such a vivid 
                    memory of going to see the show at the Pageant with my best friend. Despite this 
                    album being more produced than their previous releases, it still feels nice and raw.

                <h2>Rumours</h2>
                <h3>Fleetwood Mac</h3>
                <h4>1977</h4>
                <p>Continuing the theme of sad catchy beats, I have to give Fleetwood Mac an OG nod here. 
                    This album tells an incredible story (and yet still so relatable??), and how the 
                    band holds it together is beyond me.

                <img src="images/deja-entendu.jpg" />
                <h2>Deja Entendu</h2>
                <h3>Brand New</h3>
                <h4>2003</h4>
                <p>The album (and band) that has stayed with me since my middle school years. This was 
                    another hard one to pick a favorite for, but each song has meant something to me 
                    during different times. It's funny to think of how deep I thought I was as a 
                    13-year old.

                <img src="images/building-nothing.jpg" />
                <h2>Building Nothing Out of Something</h2>
                <h3>Modest Mouse</h3>
                <h4>1999</h4>
                <p>I liked a couple of Modest Mouse albums in high school, but this one hit me after 
                    the fact. And it came at a good time. It's comprised of other songs from other albums/
                    b-sides, so maybe that's why the sad theme works so well here.
                </p>

                <img src="images/in-rainbows.jpg" />
                <h2>In Rainbows</h2>
                <h3>Radiohead</h3>
                <h4>2007</h4>
                <p>This is the least blatant sad album of the list. It does have its sad songs, and I 
                    most cherished it during a sad time in my life. But for a Radiohead album, it's damn 
                    catchy. There are other Radiohead albums that I've listened to more, but this one has 
                    sentimental value.
